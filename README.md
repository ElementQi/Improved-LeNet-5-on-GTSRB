# Simple Improved LeNet-5 on GTSRB (Traffic Sign Classification)

#### WARNING
There are DNS spoofing in some regions in China or other places, which leads to the images cannot be shown.

## Declaration

This is the project for class Data Science Programming II.

There are `report` file, presentation `ppt` and `draft`, `jupyter notebook` file(s), `log` files, `model(HDF5)` files, and dataset examples in the repository.

## Reference

**Mainly based on the paper.**

I download those:

+ GTSRB_Final_Test_GT.zip (csv) (I unzip this file into the test images folder)
+ GTSRB_Final_Test_Images.zip (ppm+csv)
+ GTSRB_Final_Training_Images.zip (ppm+csv)

There is also a file called `signnames.csv`, which maps numbers into class names. I found it on kaggle.
